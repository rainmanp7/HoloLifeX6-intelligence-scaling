üß† CONSCIOUSNESS CORE MODULE - HIGHER-ORDER THOUGHT (HOT) THEORY

This module implements a pure, quantifiable measure of metacognitive consciousness
based on Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theory. It measures the system's awareness
of its own internal states - consciousness of being conscious.

The primary metric is Higher-Order Relational Complexity (œÅ), which quantifies
the complexity and irreducibility of the system's self-monitoring loop.

    calculate_rho(cv, meta_cognitive_score, self_model_fidelity, loop_latency, effective_information)

Calculates Higher-Order Relational Complexity (œÅ), a metric for metacognitive consciousness
based on Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theory.

This measures the complexity of the self-monitoring loop itself, not a base-level state.

Args:
- `meta_cognitive_score` (Float64): Quality/accuracy of the higher-order analysis (the "thought about the thought").
- `self_model_fidelity` (Float64): How well the system's self-model (HOT) maps to its actual state (M).
- `loop_latency` (Float64): Time for the metacognitive loop, proxy for self-referential efficiency.
- `effective_information` (Float64): Information in the first-order state (M) being monitored.
